# Solution Description:

To build my solution, I have choosen the nodejs runtime environment as I am a fullStack developer JS, and it's progressive and scalable framework `NestJS` with integrated Modules.

### appliction Details:

- The application will runing in the port: `3000`.
- I Have created A url global prefix : `/api`.
- Also, I have used, a versioning system to run many version on the application, so currently The application will have two versions v1 and v2 : `/v1` or `/v2`
- => the path to get access to the app is `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/`.
- => Example for pinging use the url `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/ping`.
- => get access the openAPI swagger Interface: `http://localhost:3000/swagger`

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test
